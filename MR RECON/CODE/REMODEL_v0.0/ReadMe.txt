1. fieldmap.py python file can be used to generate ksapce of images currupted by simulated field map having offresonace frequency +/- 50kHz (input image is of size 64x64) 
2. REMODEL is trained for 32000 brain images and "chkPoint" folder is having the learned model. Test images are available in "TestData" folder. To test the REMODEL performance on test images run the REMODEL.py for one iteration 
3. Results are available in cls_pred_test in the form of numpy array.
